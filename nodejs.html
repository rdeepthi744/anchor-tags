        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. Built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js enables the development of fast and scalable network applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications such as chat apps, streaming services, and APIs. With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, enabling full-stack JavaScript development. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and packages available through npm (Node Package Manager), making it easy to build and manage complex server-side applications.
