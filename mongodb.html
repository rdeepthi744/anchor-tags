    MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database designed for storing and managing large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). This allows developers to store complex data structures more naturally and without needing a fixed schema. MongoDB is highly scalable and supports features like replication, sharding, and powerful query capabilities, making it ideal for modern applications that require high performance and flexibility. It is widely used in web development, real-time analytics, content management, and other areas where rapid development and handling of large, dynamic datasets are crucial.
