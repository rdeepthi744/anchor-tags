<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic building blocks for webpages by using a system of tags and elements to define text, images, links, forms, and other types of content. HTML works alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to create fully functional and visually appealing websites. Each HTML document begins with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, followed by the <html>, <head>, and <body> sections, which organize the metadata and content of the page. With HTML, developers can build well-structured webpages that can be displayed correctly across different browsers and devices.</p>
