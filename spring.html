        Spring is a powerful, lightweight framework for building enterprise-level Java applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, making it easier to manage components, handle dependencies, and build scalable, secure, and maintainable systems. One of the core features of Spring is dependency injection, which promotes loose coupling and enhances testability. The framework also offers robust modules for building web applications (Spring MVC), working with databases (Spring Data), handling security (Spring Security), and managing transactions. Spring Boot, a popular extension of the Spring framework, simplifies project setup and configuration, enabling developers to create production-ready applications quickly. Widely used in enterprise environments, Spring is known for its flexibility, performance, and integration capabilities.
