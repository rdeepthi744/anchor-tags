    <p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework used to develop responsive and mobile-first websites quickly and efficiently. It includes a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, modals, and carousels. Bootstrap simplifies the process of designing consistent and visually appealing web pages by providing a grid system and utility classes for layout, spacing, typography, and more. Originally developed by Twitter, Bootstrap helps developers save time by reducing the need to write custom styles from scratch. Its responsive design features ensure that web pages look good on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.</p>
