        SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data using simple, English-like commands. SQL is essential for tasks such as querying data with SELECT, inserting new records with INSERT, updating existing data with UPDATE, and removing data with DELETE. It also provides commands for defining database structures (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) and managing user permissions. SQL is widely supported by popular database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite. Its ability to handle large volumes of structured data efficiently makes SQL a fundamental skill in data analysis, software development, and database administration.
