   <p>JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It works alongside HTML and CSS to create rich user experiences by enabling features like form validation, interactive maps, content updates without reloading the page (using AJAX), animations, and more. JavaScript can be run directly in the browser, making it essential for front-end development, but it is also used on the server-side with platforms like Node.js. With its wide range of libraries and frameworks—such as React, Angular, and Vue—JavaScript has become one of the most popular and versatile languages in modern web development.
